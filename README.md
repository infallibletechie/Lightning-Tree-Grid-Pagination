# Lightning-Tree-Grid-Pagination
Pagination Lightning Tree Grid using LWC.

Note:
1. Pagination is done in client side(JavaScript). So, this is not the ideal solution for mass records.
2. Consider checking the page performance before using it in Production.
3. Use less columns for better performance.
4. Use Apex with Offset if you want to handle more data up to 2000.  
5. Apex is called just once. So, data will be stale if the page is not refreshed
